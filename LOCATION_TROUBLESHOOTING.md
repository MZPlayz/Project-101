- **Alternative**: Make sure you have a good internet connection

#### **"Location information unavailable"**
- **Solution**: Check if your device's location services are enabled
- **Alternative**: Try using a different browser

#### **"Location services require HTTPS"**
- **Solution**: Make sure you're accessing the app via `http://localhost:3000`
- **Note**: This is normal for development - the app works on localhost

### ‚úÖ **4. Mobile-Specific Issues**

#### **iOS Safari:**
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Location Services

### ‚úÖ **5. Alternative: Manual Location Entry**

If location detection still doesn't work:

1. **Search for your location** in the pickup box
2. **Type common Dhaka locations** like:
   - Dhanmondi
   - Gulshan
   - Banani
   - Uttara
   - Mirpur
   - Tejgaon

3. **Use the search suggestions** that appear as you type

### ‚úÖ **6. Developer Mode (For Testing)**

If you're testing the app in development:

1. **Make sure you're using** `http://localhost:3000` (not a different port)
2. **Try in incognito mode** to rule out extension conflicts
3. **Check the browser console** (F12) for any error messages

### üéØ **Why This Happens**

Location services require:
- **User permission** (you must click "Allow")
- **Secure context** (HTTPS or localhost)
- **Browser support** (all modern browsers support this)
- **Device location services** enabled

### üöÄ **Test Your Fix**

After following these steps:
1. **Refresh the page** (F5)
2. **Click the üìç button** next to the pickup location
3. **You should see** "Got your current location successfully!" notification

- **Click the ‚ùì button** next to the location button in the app
- **Check browser console** (F12) for specific error messages
- **Try a different browser** if the issue persists

**The app works perfectly even without location access - you can always enter locations manually!** üó∫Ô∏è
