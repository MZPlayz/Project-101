## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ installed
- Mapbox API key (get from [Mapbox](https://mapbox.com))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sameer-dev-stack/Project-101.git
   cd Project-101/uber-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Mapbox API Key**
   ```bash
   # Update client/.env file
   REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_mapbox_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the app**
   - **Frontend**: http://localhost:3001
   - **Backend**: http://localhost:5001

### Mapbox Setup

1. Go to [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and create an account
2. Navigate to your [Access Tokens](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/)
3. Copy your default public token or create a new one
4. Add the token to your `.env` file as `REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`

Your access token is already configured in the .env file:
```
REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=pk.eyJ1IjoibXpwbGF5eiIsImEiOiJjbWNwdjF5cXAwYnBqMmxzYnN4ZTZkOTVtIn0.n_yE9wLiU49DZgSeOv_Ngg
```

## Usage

### Basic Flow

1. **Open the app** - The map will load showing your current location
2. **View nearby cabs** - Animated cab markers appear on the map
3. **Select pickup location** - Use the search box or click on map
4. **Select destination** - Choose your drop-off location
5. **Book a cab** - Click "Book Cab" to start the process
6. **Track driver** - Watch real-time driver movement and route
7. **Trip progress** - Monitor pickup → trip → completion phases
8. **Trip completion** - View summary and book next ride

### Features in Detail

#### Real-time Cab Tracking
- Nearby cabs update every 2-3 seconds
- Smooth animations show realistic movement patterns
- Different cab availability states

#### Location Selection
- Google Places autocomplete with smart suggestions
- Current location detection
- Manual coordinate entry support
- Address validation and geocoding

#### Trip States
The app manages five distinct trip states:
- `idle` - Ready to book
- `booking` - Processing booking request
- `pickup` - Driver coming to pickup location
- `in_progress` - Trip in progress
- `completed` - Trip finished

#### WebSocket Events
Real-time communication uses these events:
```javascript
// Client → Server
nearByCabs    // Request nearby cabs
requestCab    // Book a cab

// Server → Client  
nearByCabs    // Nearby cab locations
cabBooked     // Booking confirmation
pickUpPath    // Route to pickup
location      // Driver location updates
cabIsArriving // Driver approaching
cabArrived    // Driver at pickup
tripStart     // Trip begins
tripPath      // Trip route
tripEnd       // Trip completed
```

## Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Start both client and server
npm run client:dev   # Start React development server
npm run server:dev   # Start Node.js server with nodemon
npm run build        # Build client for production
npm run test         # Run tests
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run typecheck    # Run TypeScript check
```

### Code Structure

#### Frontend (React)
- **Components**: Reusable UI components
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks for state management and animations
- **Services**: API communication and utilities

#### Backend (Node.js)
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time communication
- **Cab Simulator**: Realistic cab movement simulation
- **Directions Service**: Route calculation and path generation

#### Shared
- **Event Definitions**: WebSocket event types and validation
- **State Management**: Trip state transitions and validation
- **Utilities**: Shared helper functions

### Key Technical Decisions

#### Animation System
- Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for 60fps smooth movement
- Easing functions for natural motion (`easeInOutCubic`)
- Bearing calculation for proper car rotation
- Optimized for performance with cleanup

#### State Management
- Validated state transitions prevent invalid states
- Persistent trip data throughout state changes
- Error recovery and connection state handling

#### WebSocket Architecture
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Message queuing during disconnections
- Connection health monitoring with heartbeat

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm run test:client     # Client tests only
npm run test:server     # Server tests only
npm run test:e2e        # End-to-end tests
```

## Deployment

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build           # Creates optimized production build
```

### Environment Configuration
- Set appropriate API keys for production
- Configure CORS for production domains
- Set up proper error logging and monitoring
- Enable HTTPS for production deployment

### Deployment Options
- **Vercel/Netlify**: For static client deployment
- **Heroku/Railway**: For full-stack deployment
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment
- **AWS/GCP**: Cloud infrastructure deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Google Maps not loading
- Check API key is correctly set in `.env`
- Verify required APIs are enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Check browser console for specific error messages

#### WebSocket connection issues
- Ensure server is running on correct port (3001)
- Check firewall settings
- Verify CORS configuration for your domain

#### Animation performance issues
- Check if hardware acceleration is enabled
- Monitor browser performance tab
- Reduce animation complexity if needed

### Debug Mode
Set `NODE_ENV=development` for additional logging and debug information.
