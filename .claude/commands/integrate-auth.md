# Integrate Authentication System

You are integrating the VelocityGo authentication system with the existing ridesharing app.

## Task
Merge the authentication system from https://github.com/MZPlayz/VelocityGo.git with the current ridesharing app to create a complete authenticated ridesharing platform.

## Integration Plan
Read and follow the INTEGRATION_PLAN.md file in the project root for complete integration strategy.

## Process
1. **Clone VelocityGo repository** into auth-service folder
2. **Restructure project** for microservices architecture  
3. **Create API Gateway** to route between services
4. **Set up JWT authentication** flow between services
5. **Integrate frontend** auth components with ridesharing UI
6. **Test complete user journey** from login to ridesharing features

## Requirements
- Follow the microservices architecture from INTEGRATION_PLAN.md
- Maintain all existing ridesharing functionality
- Implement seamless authentication flow
- Ensure JWT tokens work across all services
- Create unified user experience
- Test all integrations thoroughly

## Success Criteria
- Users can register/login through auth interface
- Authenticated users can access all ridesharing features  
- Real-time WebSocket features work with authentication
- Seamless UI/UX across auth and ridesharing
- All existing functionality preserved and enhanced

## Output
Complete integrated application with authentication and ridesharing features working together seamlessly.
